# Team members: Aditya Varadaraj, Saurabh Palande, Jeffin Johny, Prateek Verma


Libraries required:
    Scipy(odeint)
    Numpy
    Matplotlib


Instructions:
1. Unzip the code.zip file containing the code files.
2. To run the code for fixed stiffness:

    $ python3 fixed_stiffness.py
3. To run the code for adaptive stiffness:

    $ python3 adaptive_stiffness.py
4. To run the code for force feedback:

    $ python3 force_feedback.py
5. To run the code for enhancement 1:

    $ python3 enhancement_1.py


Additional information:
* All the parameters used in the code are in the file params.py in the Utils folder.
The results/plots are stored in the Results folder.


* This code is designed for any number of movements(going up and going down) i.e., dorsiflexions and plantarflexions.


* To change the number of movements modify the “n_movements” parameter in the respective files as needed.
